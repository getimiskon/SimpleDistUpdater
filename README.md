# Simple Distribution Updater
Easy to use graphical updater for most Linux distributions

It is made as a tool to learn how to create a GTK graphical interface using Python. Feel free to request an option for your distribution and/or report any issues you may encounter.

## How to use it
Run the `updater.py` file using terminal, choose your distribution, type your password and wait until the update ends.

## Known Issues

Terminal is needed to use the program.

The command for Fedora may not be the right one. I haven't used Fedora myself, so I don't know much about it.
